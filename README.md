# BMR Calculator Tool

## Overview

The **BMR Calculator** is a simple tool that allows users to calculate their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which is the amount of energy expended while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment. The calculator supports input of basic user data such as age, gender, weight, and height to compute their BMR using popular formulas like the Harris-Benedict equation.

### Features

- **Easy Input**: Users can input their gender, age, weight, and height to get accurate BMR calculations.
- **Accurate Calculation**: The tool uses reliable formulas like the Harris-Benedict equation to determine BMR.
- **JavaScript-Based**: Lightweight and fast, with all calculations performed on the client-side.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Formula Used

The BMR calculation is based on the **Harris-Benedict** equation, which varies based on gender:

### For Men:

\[
\text{BMR} = 88.362 + (13.397 \times \text{weight in kg}) + (4.799 \times \text{height in cm}) - (5.677 \times \text{age in years})
\]

### For Women:

\[
\text{BMR} = 447.593 + (9.247 \times \text{weight in kg}) + (3.098 \times \text{height in cm}) - (4.330 \times \text{age in years})
\]

## How to Use

1. **Input** your age, gender, weight (in kg), and height (in cm).
2. Click the **Calculate** button.
3. The tool will display your BMR value in calories per day.
